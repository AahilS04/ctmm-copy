ctmm: Continuous-Time Movement Modeling
=======

ctmm is an R package for analyzing animal tracking data as a continuous-time stochastic processes. Package features include FFT variogram and Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis, Kalman-filter maximum-likelihood estimation, Kriging, simulation, and autocorrelated kernel-density home-range estimation.

First-time users can start with the Methods in Ecology and Evolution paper [ctmm: an r package for analyzing animal relocation data as a continuous-time stochastic process](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12559/abstract) and then move on to the up-to-date vignettes `vignette('variogram')` and `vignette('akde')`.
